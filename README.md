## Overview

Medi-Link is a full-stack web application designed to provide users with a dynamic dashboard interface that displays key metrics, data visualizations, and detailed views of various data entities. The backend is powered by **Node.js** and **Express**, which handle API requests, user authentication, and database interactions. The frontend, built in **React**, communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs, rendering a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Features

- **User Authentication:**  
  Secure login, registration, and session management.
  
- **Dashboard:**  
  An interactive dashboard displaying summary cards, graphs, and recent activity.
  
- **Detailed Views:**  
  Pages dedicated to displaying detailed information on specific data items with options for editing or deletion.
  
- **Profile Management:**  
  User profile and settings pages where users can update their personal information and preferences.
  
- **Responsive Design:**  
  Optimized layouts for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**  
  - React
  - React Router
  - Redux/Context API (state management)
  - Axios (for API calls)
  - CSS/SCSS or styled-components for styling

- **Backend:**  
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB or PostgreSQL (database)
  - Mongoose/Sequelize (ORM/ODM)
  - JWT for authentication

- **Other Tools:**  
  - Git for version control
  - Figma for UI/UX design
  - ESLint and Prettier for code quality
  - Jest/Mocha & Chai for testing

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- A running instance of your chosen database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medi-link.git
cd medi-link
```

### Setup the Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example` and configure your environment variables:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Setup the Frontend

1. In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file if needed (refer to documentation for environment variables):

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. Start the React development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

- **Development:**  
  The application runs with hot-reloading for both frontend and backend.
  
- **Production Build:**  
  For the frontend, create a production build:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  Then, deploy the static files to your preferred hosting service. For the backend, use a process manager like PM2 for deployment.

- **Testing:**  
  Run unit and integration tests:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
